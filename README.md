Steam Trading Cards--Data Analysis

What are Steam trading cards and why do they matter?

Steam trading cards are sort of digital collectibles associated with specific games. Each trading card depicts particular characters, environments, or other aspects of a game. The trading cards themselves have value in part due to individuals' interest in collecting memorabilia and other media associated with their favorite games, but also because by obtaining a full set of trading cards for a given game, he or she can acquire a Steam badge. Steam badges can be showcased on Steam profiles, and will also provide Steam users with higher experience, which can eventually lead to a higher Steam profile level (a sort of prestige or status). Finally, trading cards up to a point can be acquired simply by playing a specific game, but typically users will need to trade or buy trading cards in order to acquire a full set of trading cards for any given game. See discussion below for more details.

A Brief Description of the Economics of Steam Trading Cards:

Each game on Steam has a set amount of trading cards. They can be received when Steam users play the given game at no charge beyond the price they paid to purchase the game. However, there is a limit to the number of trading cards users get by playing any given game such that an individual user can usually never get all trading cards from merely playing a particular game. Except for users with a high Steam user level and quite a bit of luck, almost no one will get trading cards by merely playing a given game. As a result, there's a bit of induced scarcity with respect to Steam trading cards. This scarcity results in higher Steam trading card values since it incentivizes users to trade, buy, or sell some of their trading cards to acquire the other trading cards they want to get a booster pack. 

For more discussion of the business and psychology of Steam trading cards, see this 2013 article: [The Psychology Behind Steam Trading Cards] (https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-psychology-behind-steam-trading-cards). 

While many steam trading cards range from around 4-12 cents (ie, in USD)--NB: I need to do a more empirical analysis to verify whether this intuition is correct--some are as expensive as >$1000 USD!

FRom the standpoint of Steam and PC game publishers, Steam trading cards are also a source of revenue. While the largest percentage of money obtained from the sale of a Steam trading card goes to the Steam user who sold his or her trading card, a certain percentage is also obtained by Steam and the publisher company who published the particular PC game. According to this unfortunately not-recent Reddit post--[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/2pt1xb/trading_cards_are_a_meaningless_gimmick_sales/)--a somewhat higher percent is obtained by the publisher company than Steam, but altogether a cummulative 13%-15% of the total value of a Steam trading card sale price goes to the publisher and Steam. 

To-Dos and Analysis Goals:
1) Get some Steam trading card data. Also, get some data on dates when specific games go on sale, including specific dates associated with large-scale site-wide Steam sales. In addition, get data on dates for in-game events--this is especially relevant for PvP-oriented games such as Hunt: Showdown, Chivalry 2: ie, games that likely see spikes in player counts during said events. 

2) Examine whether median sale prices of Steam trading cards, for a given game (ie, on average), tend to be higher during in-game events?

3) Similarly, examine whether median sale prices of Steam trading cards, for a given game (ie, on average), tend to be higher during large essentially site-wide Steam sales such as Holiday sales? Also, what about sales for specific games that do not coincide with large-scale Steam sales--do these individual game sales lead to higher Steam trading card median prices?

Economically, I hypothesize that Steam trading cards will have higher median prices during any sort of sales that result in lower prices on Steam for a given game. The reason for this is that the sale of PC games on Steam act are a sort of economic complement to Steam trading cards. And, when the price of one good goes down, the demand for its complement increases. Along these lines too, more individuals will play a particular game after it goes on sale.

Again, however, this is merely a hypothesis, and it needs to be tested with real-world data.
